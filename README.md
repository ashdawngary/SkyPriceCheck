# SkyPriceCheck

litearly spent 2 hours on this ( Created by AshX101/intelX)

usage

`python -i price.py`, currently using interactive stuff because i dont know discord :(

it populates a variable called q which holds the table.  Here are some nifty commands you can do:



q.guestimate(string) returns you a very close autocorrected version of the answer  
q.modify(original_name,field,value) run a DB update query 
q.publish() publish the DB changes 
q.estimate_literalOrItem(string) estaimtes a price for the item, if its coins it will interpret it to, returns [lowerbound,upperbound] and they can be equal 
q.eval(string) litearly a calculator, returns a lowerbound,upperbound


ok thanks bye
